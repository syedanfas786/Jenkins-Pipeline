This Jenkins pipeline automates the CI/CD process, ensuring smooth build, testing, security checks, and deployment. Here's a brief summary:

### Stages:

1. **Build**:
   - The build stage compiles the project, confirming the use of Maven.

2. **Unit and Integration Tests**:
   - Executes unit and integration tests using JUnit. Based on the outcome (success or failure), email notifications are sent to `syedanfas786@gmail.com`, with logs attached for review.

3. **Code Analysis**:
   - Conducts code analysis, logging completion, and using JUnit for validation.

4. **Security Scan**:
   - Runs a security scan with JMeter. Similar to the test stage, it sends email notifications on success or failure, attaching logs for review.

5. **Deploy to Staging**:
   - Deploys the application to the staging environment. No email is sent at this stage, but success is logged.

6. **Integration Tests on Staging**:
   - Executes integration tests on the staging environment using JMeter, confirming successful test completion.

7. **Deploy to Production**:
   - Finally, the application is deployed to the production environment, confirming the success of the deployment.

### Notification System:
Email notifications are sent during the testing and security scan stages to keep the recipient updated with success or failure status, including log files for debugging purposes.

This pipeline provides a streamlined approach to CI/CD, ensuring robust testing, security, and deployment for continuous delivery.
